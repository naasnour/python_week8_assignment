# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is part of the Python Week 8 assignment for the Power Learn Project Academy. It is a data analysis report that visualizes COVID-19 trends globally, focusing on Senegal, India, and the United States.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Import and clean real-world COVID-19 data
- Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare metrics between countries
- Create visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn
- Communicate insights clearly in a data report

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is from **Our World in Data** and is publicly available [here](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv).

## 🧠 How to Run the Project

1. Download the dataset and save it as `owid-covid-data.csv` in the same folder as the Python file.
2. Run the Python script using **IDLE** or any Python editor.
3. The script will:
   - Load and clean the dataset
   - Analyze and group the data
   - Create five plots (line, bar, histogram, scatter, and vaccination trend)
   - Print summary observations

> Make sure all required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) are installed.

## 📊 Summary of Key Insights

- The United States has the highest total cases and vaccinations among the three countries.
- Senegal has lower case numbers and a steady vaccination curve.
- India shows varied trends across time but significant progress in vaccinations.
- Visualizations reveal patterns in death rates, vaccination progress, and overall cases.
